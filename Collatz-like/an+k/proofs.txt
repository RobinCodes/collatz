(all the proofs manually in handbook, maybe some niche funfacts about behaviour.)
f(n) = {
    --> an+k, if n ≡ 1 (mod 2)
    --> n/2, if n ≡ 0 (mod 2)
}
--------------------
for a = 0 for every n, k a loop is entered.
- for odd k, loop: k->k
- for even k, loop: (preperiod) -> odd -> |loop_begins| k -> k
for k = 0 for every n, a:
- odd a: sequence diverges
- even a: sequence diverges 
- - unless a = 2^x, then it forms an odd -> big_even loop, which is log_2(a) + 2 long.
for a even, k odd, for all n sequence diverges.
for a odd, k even, for all n sequence diverges.
c(n) denotes the count of functions with a, k < n and nontrivial behaviour ( for now )

    ⎧ (N^2)/2 - N + 1, if N is even,
c(n)
    ⎨ ((N-1)^2)/2, if N is odd.
    ⎩

for a = 1 for every n, k:
- even k: all sequences diverge from odds
- odd k: downwards-trend argument proof: all must loop
- - two loops: 1 -> ... -> 1 and k -> 2k -> k

----------------- individual function proofs ---------------------
a = 2, k = 2
all sequences must loop. (downwards-trend argument proof).
only loop: 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 (informal proof!)

----------------- observations of individual functions -------------------
from this point onwards, some new method would have to be discovered in order to prove
behaviour of all sequences (since downwards-trend argument proof no longer works),
so I will be making observations of the remaining 2 functions with a, k in [0,3]

a = 3, k = 1:
all sequences must loop.
only loop is 1->4->2->1

a = 3, k = 3
all sequences must loop.
only loop is 6 -> 3 -> 12
